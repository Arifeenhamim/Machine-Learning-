This code implements a Linear Regression workflow designed for real estate price prediction. The process begins by loading 
and cleaning the dataset to handle potential missing values, followed by defining the feature set using size_sqft, 
bedrooms, and age_years. The specific target of this analysis is the Price_Thousands variable, aiming to estimate 
property values based on these physical attributes. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, the 
linear model is trained and evaluated. The results are highly effective, achieving an R-squared ($R^2$) score of 
approximately 0.96, which indicates the model explains 96% of the variance in house prices. The analysis concludes with a 
visualization plotting house size against price, confirming a strong positive correlation between the two.
